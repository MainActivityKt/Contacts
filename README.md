# Contacts

In this project, the program will be able to create contacts
(like on the mobile phone) and search for people or organizations by name.

## Stage 1/4 :
In the first stage, the program creates an
instance of a class that stores information about one record in the Contacts.

One record should contain a name, a surname, and a phone number, which the user type them
from the keyboard.
